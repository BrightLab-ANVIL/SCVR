### How to Use:
These scripts were designed to take outputs from higher-level/group-level modeling including:
- T-statistic map (other statistical map would also probably work)
- Group mask (this is the mask in which the group analyses were run in)

---
### Notes:
- [Randomise](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Randomise) was used for higher-level modeling in the development of these methods
